# Python-Ransomware

YouTube Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScL07VJJOX4

To test the Ransomware out on your machine,

* edit lines 49 and 140 in the ransomware.py file with your own absolute paths etc for testing purposes and so you can use the localRoot folder

* [ATTACKER] Run the RSA script to generate two keys, a private and public key

* [TARGET] Run the ransomware script

* [ATTACKER] Run the fernet key decryption file to decrypt the EMAIL_ME.txt file, this will give you a PUT_ME_ON_DESKtOP.txt file, once you put this on the desktop the ransomware will decrypt the localRoot files in that directory

... watch the tutoiral to understand the scripts better. I quickly go over the scripts lightly in first 5 mins, I then run through the scripts and showcase the ransomware working etc and act the roles of the attacker/target out and show you it working etc, I then go over the scripts in more detail afterwards.
